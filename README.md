# Business Opportunities Analysis

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can classify a financial news article as a *business opportunity* (an article related to the earnings of a company) or not. The traning set consists of news article in XML format as well the associated class of each news article. The news articles are extracted from the financial news feed [Reuter](https://www.reuter.com/). The sheer textual nature of news articles led me to build a machine learning model based on NLP techniques to enrich the predictions.

The details of my analysis are all in the Jupyter Notebook *Final_Experiment.ipynb*.
I especially make use of the library [spacy.io](https://www.spacy.io) to perform NLP.
